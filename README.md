## Summary 
The data set is about people and their reading habits within a one year period. I will be analysing the data, cleaning it, visualising it, and drawing conclusions based on several questions. I will also be hypothesis testing and applying statistical concepts.

The data set can be found on Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/vipulgote4/reading-habit-dataset

## These are the questions that I would like to answer
1. Is there a preference for a certain book format based on sex?
2. Does education determine whether a person reads more?
3. Does age determine whether a person reads more?
4. What is the average amount of books read per sex?
5. Which race tends to read more?
6. Does income affect the number of printed books read?
7. Does level of employment affect number of books read?
8. What is the preferred method of getting a book?
